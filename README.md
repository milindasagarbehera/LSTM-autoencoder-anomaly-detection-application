# LSTM-autoencoder-anomaly-detection-application
Built a production-ready FastAPI + React application to monitor server metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk, Network). Applied data science models—LSTM Autoencoders and Isolation Forest—to detect anomalies and trigger real-time alerts, enabling proactive infrastructure monitoring.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Real-time anomaly detection** on server telemetry data
- 🧠 **AI-powered analysis** to explain detected anomalies
- 🔁 **Automatic weekly retraining** with newly ingested data
- 🔒 **Model validation enforcement** — rejects models with poor validation loss
- 📥 **Automated data download** from remote host every week
- 📧 **Email alerts** sent to registered users on anomaly detection
- 📅 **Scheduled retraining every Sunday** (customizable)
- 📈 **Interactive dashboard** showing model performance, anomaly timelines, and retrain logs

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic, Celery, SQLite/PostgreSQL
- **ML Engine:** LSTM Autoencoder, Isolation Forest (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras)
- **Frontend:** React + TailwindCSS
- **Scheduler:** APScheduler / Celery Beat
- **Notifications:** SMTP email integration
- **Monitoring:** Matplotlib + Plotly for visual insights

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Each server** has its own anomaly detection model.
2. Models are trained weekly on **cleaned, validated telemetry data**.
3. If the new model's validation loss is **above threshold**, it is rejected.
4. **All anomalies** are automatically:
   - Flagged visually on the dashboard
   - Explained using AI text generation (LLM prompt)
   - Logged to the database
   - Sent via email to subscribed users
5. All data is automatically fetched from a configured host during retrain.

---

## 📅 Retraining Schedule

- 🕒 Models auto-retrain every **Sunday at 2:00 AM**
- ✅ Only accepted if validation loss is below configured threshold
- 🔁 Full logs and scores viewable on the dashboard

---

## 📧 Email Notifications

- Users can register emails for specific servers
- Alerts are sent when:
  - Anomaly is detected
  - Model retrain fails or is rejected
  - Retrain completes with summary

---

## 🧠 AI-Powered Anomaly Insight

Each anomaly is passed to an AI agent (e.g., LLM) that summarizes:
- What changed
- What metrics were involved
- Suggested reasons or interpretations
